# New AboutSection Illustration: Laptop Mockup Style

## Reference
The screenshot shows a MacBook on a wooden desk displaying a warm-toned website, surrounded by lifestyle props (vase with pampas grass, coffee cup, glasses). Clean, elegant, beige/taupe palette.

## What We'll Build
A new SVG illustration replacing the current abstract wireframe+leaves composition in `AboutSection.tsx`. The new illustration will feature:

- **A realistic laptop/MacBook frame** with rounded corners, dark bezel, and keyboard hint at the bottom
- **A website preview inside the screen** using warm beige/sand tones, showing a two-column layout with an image placeholder on the left and text lines + a CTA button on the right (mimicking a real landing page)
- **Desk surface** - a subtle wooden/warm line beneath the laptop
- **Lifestyle props** rendered as simple, elegant SVG shapes:
  - A round vase with pampas grass/dried branches (left side)
  - A coffee cup on a saucer (right side)
  - Optional: glasses silhouette near the laptop

## Color Palette
All using existing CSS variables: `primary`, `olive`, `sand`, `warm-beige`, `toasted`, `charcoal` - matching the earthy, rustic-minimalist aesthetic.

## Technical Details
- **File modified:** `src/components/AboutSection.tsx` only
- Replace the `AboutIllustration` component's SVG content
- No new dependencies or files needed
- Estimated cost: **1-2 credits**
